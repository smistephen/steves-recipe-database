# Steve's Recipe Database

Hello and welcome! This is a sample project I made that I own the rights to, for purposes of portfolio display. It runs on Django 2.x and Python 3.x, with a sprinkle of Bootstrap for sparkle.

The site is simple, but if you examine the code, it uses most of Django's features in one way or another.

If you'd like to run this site locally, make sure to rename the settings file in the `recipedatabase` folder, and set a proper secret key.

You can also visit the site running live at https://HireSteve.ca/recipes.

Have a nice day!
